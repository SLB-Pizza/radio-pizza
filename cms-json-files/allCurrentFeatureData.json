His SoundCloud only goes back about five years though, and his Bandcamp tells an even shorter tale. Either way, he’s been on the steady up cline lately with a range of fire releases over the past few years. But his latest release Born Again (August 2020) is said to be his standout project. Produced by Zoomo -another city staple- the project is twelve tracks of smooth, soul-filled beats accompanied by YL’s effortlessly-styled bars. I meet with YL on a sunny day in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan. His bedroom walls are lined with records and classic New York rap echoes throughout his apartment, it’s obvious he is serious about his stuff. The 27-year-old emcee also produces beats, engineers, makes mixes for London’s infamous NTS Radio, and consistently works with his squad RRR (Real Recognise Real). He’s always moving and morphing within the music world, and if there’s anything you should know about New York rappers: the grind never stops.",

Lemme just give a few shoutouts: Starker, he’s someone you should peep. Roper Williams, he’s a producer. Me and him have albums. You go on my Bandcamp, he’s done at least three of my projects, all him. Koncept Jack$on. Rbchmbrs, Theravada, Lord Jah-Monte Ogbon, Grimm Doza. My boy MID, he’s an artist from RRR, my camp.

You’re always just listening to music as a fan. You’re always going to find some obscure shit. You’ll end up in like a YouTube rabbit hole, or SoundCloud. You might have a bunch of places, you might not have no place at all. And just like from there, for me, I always make the effort to connect with artists,  new artists especially. Nobody is playing their shit, and I think their shit is dope as fuck, so it deserves a platform. And when I do that, a lot of those artists are like, “fuck, we thank you so much.” We build a relationship and then eventually I'm like, “yo, we should work on a project together.” I already planted a seed out of love just by supporting it.
