title: What is Half Moon?
---

### An Incubation space where music culture flourishes openly.

Founded in 2017, Half Moon was born out of the need to defy. Essentially, we are destroying mainstream radio and building a platform that allows music and culture to thrive without limits. We pride ourselves in bringing our audience live, uncensored and undiscovered music from a grass-roots perspective reminding the world that the underground is where the sublime lives, grows and becomes timeless.
