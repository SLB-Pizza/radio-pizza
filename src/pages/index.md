  title: Who We Are
  description: >-
    Founded in 2017, Half Moon was born out of the need to defy. Essentially, we
    are destroying mainstream radio and building a platform that allows music
    and culture to thrive without limits. We pride ourselves in bringing our
    audience live, uncensored and undiscovered music from a grass-roots
    perspective reminding the world that the underground is where the sublime
    lives, grows and becomes timeless.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
